# MSc OR week 0

Introduction to Python for MSc OR students.

This is related to [this course](https://github.com/IanHawke/msc-or-python) which ran late in the MSc (after the taught semesters, before the summer project). As such this course cannot use as much OR material; in addition there is significantly less time available.
