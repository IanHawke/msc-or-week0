# Comments after 29 October

* Generally seemed to go well
* Could have used more exercises - IH spent too long talking
* By dropping MC and ML completely, and not doing the complex LP intro to numpy, much less coding was needed.
* At the start of the `pulp` session did 45 minutes on objects by creating a `sourced_df` object using the `pandas` spotify example. Overrode the plus operator to cat the sources list (of strings) and the dfs. Slightly awkward as there's a few string conversions and it's less obvious than I'd like.
* Did nearly everything using scripts, which worked well.
* Showed `seaborn` at the end of the `pandas` session, which worked well, but isn't installed by default.
* `pulp` install through `pip` was surprisingly easy. However, clashes with Python2 on those (very few) machines w/o Python3.
* Timetable worked pretty precisely - finished early on the Friday, but in future could create a more complex programmatic `pulp` exercise.
